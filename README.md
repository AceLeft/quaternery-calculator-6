# Java Quaternary Calculator Using Swing
By Riley Jamison, Brooke Wright, Hunter Johns, and Payton Hutsell

## Instructions:
This is a simple Quaternary Calculator built with JFrame. A Quaternary Calculator
is a calculator for base 4 numbers. This means you will only have 0, 1, 2, and 3.

To run the program:
* Clone the repository
* Open the project in your choice of Java IDE
* Run the Main.java file

Once the program is running you will be presented with the calculator:

To perform operations, you can click on any of the buttons.
The options you have are addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, square, and square root. Along with operands there is also
a big conversion button. This converts your results between base 4 and base 10.

After getting your result you have two options. You can
start a chain of operations using each result you get, or
you can start a new operation. To start a new operation you can use
the clear all button or you can click a number.
